# AdvancedML-NeuropsychiatricDisorder-SchizophreniaCaseStudy
Repository for exploring advanced machine learning techniques in the analysis of a synthetic neuropsychiatric disorder dataset, focusing on a case study of schizophrenia-like illness.


This assignment involves creating a comprehensive report using Jupyter Notebook to apply data pre-processing, feature engineering techniques, and machine learning models introduced in the initial segment of the academic program. Students are encouraged to utilize a variety of machine learning algorithms and preprocessing steps as deemed suitable for the given task.

The focus of the assignment is on a synthetic dataset representing a 'schizophrenia-like illness'. Comprising lifestyle and symptom information for 5,000 fictional individuals, the dataset is designed to allow students to explore fundamental machine learning concepts and the challenges posed by biases in data, particularly those related to race, gender, and socio-economic status. The primary target variable in this dataset is 'Diagnosis', a binary indicator distinguishing between the presence or absence of a schizophrenia-like illness.

The assignment is segmented into five parts, each contributing to the overall evaluation. These parts include preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA), unsupervised machine learning for data insights, supervised machine learning for classification or regression, comprehensive documentation of the workflow in the Jupyter Notebook, and a presentation summarizing the findings. Students must address missing, duplicated, or outlier values, transform and encode data, engage in feature engineering, and produce insightful visualizations and analyses. The unsupervised and supervised analyses demand appropriate algorithms and metrics, while the report should be well-organized, with clear explanations, tables, and plots.
